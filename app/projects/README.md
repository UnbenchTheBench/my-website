# Projects Excel File Format

Your `ProjectsTracker.xlsx` file should have the following structure:

## Required Columns:
- **title**: The name of your project
- **description**: A brief description of what the project does
- **link**: The GitHub URL or link to view the project

## Example Data:
| title | description | link |
|-------|-------------|------|
| My Portfolio Website | A personal portfolio built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS | https://github.com/username/portfolio |
| Task Manager App | A React-based task management application | https://github.com/username/task-manager |
| Weather Dashboard | Real-time weather data visualization | https://github.com/username/weather-app |

## Notes:
- Make sure the first row contains the column headers exactly as shown above
- The file should be saved as `ProjectsTracker.xlsx` in this directory
- If the Excel file can't be read, the page will show sample projects as a fallback
- Column names are case-sensitive and must match exactly
